### Description ###

Single-molecule real-time sequencing is a third generation sequencing technology developed by Pacific BioSciences that doesn't require amplification during library preparation. Hairpin adapters are ligated to the DNA fragments to create a circular form, allowing for longer reads compared to second generation technologies and Nanopore sequencing. SMRT uses fluorescently-labeled nucleotides to measure nucleotide incorporation in real-time enabling the quantification of the transcription rate.
