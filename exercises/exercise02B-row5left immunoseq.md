# ImmunoSeq

## Summary

Immunosequencing measures TCR / BCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing using a multiplexed PCR-based assay. It allows tracking of T- and B-cells over time, characterizing the diversity of the immune repertoire and measuring the dynamics of disease and treatment.

## Linking Technology, Application and Statistics

**Technology:** immunoseq

**Application:** Sequencing of the B-cell and T-cell repertoire.

**Statistics:**
- Chi-square Test: A test to determine statistical significance of the difference in TCR and BCR abundances between samples.

- Morisita-Horn Index: A statistical measure of dispersion of individuals in a population. It accounts for both the number and abundance of shared TCRs between two repertoires (score ranges between 0 = no overlap and 1 = all clones overlap at similar frequencies).

- Jaccard Index: A similarity measure between sample sets. It's defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets. It also ranges between 1 and 0, where 1 indicates complete overlap and 0 represents no overlap.

- Yu–Clayton Index: One of the few similarity indices that can detect and compare the presence and abundance of same TCRs among samples. It has, however, only rarely been used so far in the field of immunology, as compared to the Morisita–Horn index or the Jaccard index.
